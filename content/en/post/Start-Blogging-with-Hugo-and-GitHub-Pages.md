There are already a variety of blogging platforms, software and systems created by developers around the world. Most of them, though, are either hard to construct or a lack of essential functions. In this blog, I would recommend you a kind of solutions balancing functionality and usability, which is blogging with static site generator and deploying with site hosting service.

A representative of these solutions is to blog with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and to deploy on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Here I'm introducing how to start blogging with Hugo and GitHub Pages step by step.

### Create An GitHub Repository for Storage

Note that GitHub Pages is just a deployment service, storage service not included. Hence it relies on a GitHub repository for storing the page source.

Login or sign up on GitHub, then create a new repository.

If you would just like to use the whole `<your_name>.github.io` domain as your blog, you should set the repository name to `<your_name>.github.io`, where `<your_name>` is the personal space name (as you can access your space via `https://github.com/<your_name>`). Meanwhile, you ought to set the repository accessibility to **Public**. Then click **Create repository** to create the repository.

### Add Some Pages

Now that you have create the repository, it's time to add some pages to it. Just add `index.md` to your repository on GitHub and type `# Hello World` in the file, and then save the file.

### Enable GitHub Pages

Go to **Settings** -> **Pages**. Adjust the branch selection from **None** to **main**, and set the folder to **/ (root)**. Click **Save**.

Wait, and refresh from time to time until the text **Your site is live at `https://<your_name>.github.io/`** is shown. Click the URL and you would see **Hello World** on the page.

### Get Hugo Involved

Without static site generators like Hugo, the pages will never be beautiful enough for a blog. Let's start to get Hugo involved.

Clone the repository to your local computer, and install Hugo referring to the [official instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). For Windows users, directly using the binaries is recommended. Note that you should add the path of `hugo.exe` to environment variable **PATH** to make `hugo` command work. If you would like to use some fancy third-party themes, please download the release with **extended** in its name.

Open the terminal in the directory of your repository, remove all files, and run `hugo new site . --force`. This command initializes the current directory as a Hugo project. The `--force` tag is required because the directory is not empty.

Then you need to add a theme to your blog. For beginners, using the official theme Ananke is a good choice. Run `git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke` to install the theme.

Then modify the `config.toml`, replacing all texts with belows. You can adapt the texts to your information.

```toml
baseURL = 'https://<your_name>.github.io'
languageCode = 'en'
title = 'My Blog'
theme = 'ananke'
```

Then run `hugo server` and open `http://localhost:1313` in your browser, you will see the site.

### Add Some Pages

Add some pages again, right?

But this time it's a bit different. You should run `hugo new posts/my-first-blog.md` to create. Then edit the article in `content/posts/my-first-blog.md`. You should set the title, and set **draft** to `false` like belows, and add content.

```md

title: "My First Blog"
date: 2022-09-17T22:27:37+08:00
draft: false

# My First Blog

This is my first blog!

> Don't take a short step, no one can go a thousand milesã€‚

```

### Configure GitHub Actions

It's disturbing to always buiding the site on our own computer and pushing to GitHub. Therefore, it is necessary to make the procedure automatic.

You can simply put the content below in `.github/workflow/build.yml`. You may need to create the directories to store the file.

```yml
name: Publish the Website

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build the website
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the commit
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          submodules: true
        
      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.4.13
        with:
          extended: true
      
      - name: Build the pages
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Upload as a GitHub Pages artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1.0.4
        with:
          path: public/

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    name: Deploy the website
    needs: build
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      pages: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Deploy the GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1.2.0
```

Stash all changes, commit, and push.

On GitHub, open **Settings** -> **Pages**, switch the **Source** from **Deploy from a branch** to **GitHub Actions**.

Open **Actions**, wait until the signal of latest job turns green. Visit your website.

If your website haven't changed, you should manually run the workflow again.

Now you've mastered blogging with Hugo and GitHub Pages. Just create more pages with `hugo new` command and enjoy writing!
